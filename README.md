This learning module accompanies chapter four of Angela B. and George W Shiflet's
book [Introduction to Computational Science](https://ics.wofford-ecs.org/).  The 
common theme in this chapter is system dynamics modeling systems with interactions
between multiple variables.  In this folder are:
- [An introduction to System Dynamics with Interactions](SD_Interactions_Intro.ipynb) 
 which introduces multiple variable differential equations.  It looks at different
 population dynamics models, and looks at a situation in which chaos arrises.
- Assignment When the assignment is ready it will be linked here.
